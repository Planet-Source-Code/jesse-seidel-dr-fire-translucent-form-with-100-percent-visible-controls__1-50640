### Description

With this, you can maintain a translucent form background with 100 percent visible controls! This is the Win2k/XP translucency, so it live updates! I came up with the idea for this while I was playing a game on my ps2, and I saw a translucent thing on the screen. And I started thinking about this, and I made it! Please leave feedback!
